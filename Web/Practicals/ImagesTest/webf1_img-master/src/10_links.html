    <li>To turn an image into a link, just wrap it in an anchor element (i.e. <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>)
    <li>The teapots here are relative links to fragments within this document.
    <li>Notice that here the <code>target</code> pseudo selector is used to color the target of the previously clicked link.
    <li>Notice the fragment appears at the end of the URL in the address bar and changes with each click.
