# Canvas

* Download a zip of this `ws_canvas` repository or (preferably) clone it thus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_canvas.git
```
*  From your new local `ws_canvas` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
*  Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.

For inspiration, you can use the [Stick Figures examples](https://github.com/portsoc/Web-Canvas-Stick-Figures).
