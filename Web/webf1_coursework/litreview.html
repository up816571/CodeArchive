     <h1>Social engineering relating to personal information exposure</h1>
     <p>
      With the increasing popularity of social media and a higher confidence online more personal information is being shared willingly. An increasing problem is over-sharing where too much information is disclosed which might have unintended consequences <a href="#references">(David Tayouri, 2015, p.1097)[1]</a>. This information can then be utilized by a number of people or organisations to potentially commit crimes which is formerly known as social engineering. “Social engineering is the art of tricking employees and consumers into disclosing their credentials and then using them to gain access to networks or accounts” <a href="#references">(Nabie Y. Conteh,Paul J. Schmick, 2016, p.31)[2]</a>. Better social media security and education of the users could be used to combat social engineering and mitigate personal information exposure.
     </p>
      <h2>Over sharing</h2>
      <p>
       Social engineering can be carried out anyone provided that there is enough information about themselves. Users of social media can release a large amount of information about themselves which they think has no impact, however releasing too much information can be used to build up a profile. Simple pieces of information could be used to gain access to other accounts which could be security questions. For example a pet's name could be used in a security question on a website, which would then show more personal information if the account was breached. Sumutka A says that in a test of 75 randomly selected security questions, the answer of 21 questions could be found in 10 hours without data mining technology on a target with no social media presence <a href="#references">(Sumutka A, 2016, p.21)[3]</a>. A target with social media could be more susceptible to these kind of attacks but results could be affected by the individual and how much they share. The test carried out in Sumutka A’s research could largely vary for a different target to yield either a more positive or negative result. Personal information might already be available online which could have been leaked by a company which would also increase the vulnerability of an account. “Preventing data leakage is not always possible because of the need to access, share and use information, which leads to inevitable release of confidential data” <a href="#references">(Alneyadi, S., Sithirasenan, E., &#38; Muthukkumarasamy, V , 2016, section 1.0)[4]</a>. Depending on the company that has leaked the data, potential passwords and other details may be available which would lead to more personal information exposure.
      </p>
      <h2>Spear phishing</h2>
     <p>
       There are many different methods that can be employed to gain access to an unauthorized account. One major attack currently in use is a spear phishing attack to target a specific user. Attacks might use an email from a friend to get the target to click a link or download some form of virus <a href="#references">(Tracey Caldwell, 2013, p.11 - p.16)[5]</a>. These phishing attacks can gain access to accounts which could have a large amount of personal information such as addresses, phone numbers and even banking details. If details like a personal address is leaked it can be hard to change so it is important to stop information being exposed prior to an attack. Nabie Y. Conteh also agrees that phishing is a problem but say other attacks are equally as important. These attacks include pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo, and tailgating<a href="#references">(Nabie Y. Conteh, et al, 2016, p.32)</a>. These attacks can have varying levels of success depending on the target and how tech savvy the individual is. Nabie Y. Conteh believes that the lack of resources in the cyber crime domain is the leading contributor to exponential growth<a href="#references">(Nabie Y. Conteh, et all, 2016, p.33)</a>. With a higher frequency of attacks it will become difficult for some individuals to completely avoid an attack and could lead to more personal information exposure if they are affected by a virus. This means that the mitigation strategies in place must be robust in order to protect the user and in some cases they are falling short.
     </p>
     <h2>Mitigation strategies</h2>
     <p>
       Most banks or social media websites now have included security policies and other guides in order to help the users but 65% of adult internet users have been a victim of cybercrime as of 2013 <a href="#references">(Ivaturi, K., &#38; Janczewski, L, 2013, p.25)[6]</a>. This statistic suggests that policies and guides provided by these companies are not enough and more practices need to be put into place. Two step authentication is also becoming widely adopted but is vulnerable to creating backdoors to gain access using a virus <a href="#references">(Jyotiyana, J. P., &#38; Mishra, A, 2016, p.608)[7]</a>. If a user has already been hacked by a virus then 2 step authentication will not necessarily be able to prevent an account from being accessed. Nabie Y. Conteh et al Points out 6 things which are needed in order to prevent a successful social engineering attack which are security policies, education, network guidance, audits and compliance, technical procedures, and physical guidance <a href="#references">(Nabie Y. Conteh, et al, 2016, p.34 - p.35)</a>. David also agrees that mitigation strategies should include a combination of education along with technology such as social media monitoring tools like social mention to track potential cyber crimes <a href="#references">(Tayouri, D, 2015, p.1098 - p.1099)</a>. New technology should be invested in by social media websites in order to protect their users. With social media becoming an integral part of daily life, more education on the over sharing should be taught in schools or the workplace to combat social engineering.
     </p>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>
       Currently social engineering poses a threat for security regarding personal information exposure. Generally after one account is compromised, it can be assumed that there is a large risk of other accounts to also be compromised holding a large store of personal information. Attacks like spear phishing can seem realistic to some naive users and viruses can be hard to control. A combination of education/training and new technology can be employed which will help people to not over share making social engineering harder and the chance of performing a successful spear attack less likely. Any attack is likely with a more educated populace online. New technology to monitor cyber criminal activity should eventually result in a decrease of cyber crime which should overall increase mitigation of personal information exposure on the web.
