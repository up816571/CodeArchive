# The Document Object Model

* Use git to clone this `ws_dom` repository (or if that's not possible download a zip - you should prefer and aim to use `git` from now on):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_dom.git
```
* From your new local `ws_dom` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
* Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
