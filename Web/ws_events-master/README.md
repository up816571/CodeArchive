# Events

* Use git to clone this `ws_events` repository (or if that's not possible download a zip - you should prefer and aim to use `git` from now on):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_events.git
```
*  From your new local `ws_events` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
*  Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.

For the purpose of keeping the tests as atomic as possible we have requested that you create several 'attacher' functions.  In real apps it is likely that various attachers will be grouped together during program initialisation.
