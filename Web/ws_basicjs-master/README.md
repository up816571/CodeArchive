# JavaScript Basics

* Download a zip of this `ws_basicjs` repository or (preferably) clone it thus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_basicjs.git
```
*  From your new local `ws_basicjs` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
*  Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
